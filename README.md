# industry based page design

While working on my internship, I learned a whole lot about sass, a powerful CSS compiler that uses complex and logical syntax to help large industries desing their pages with ease. I was compelled to try some of this on my own and with this project I followed each and every industry regulation like semantic tags, html page structuring, golden UI rules, design flow and other such practices followed while designing webpages. 
I already did know html beforehand but I believe perfecting every single design specification as mentioned in the figma mock-up up to the last pixel is something every front end engineer should strive to achieve. this is just my approach to it.
